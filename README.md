Step 3: After pressing the button, you will find that a console application is going to open up asking for user input to choose the type of mapping the system will apply

Step 4: If you choose Direct or Fully associative, you will be asked to input Total Cache Size (S), Cache Line Size (L), Cycles / Cache (CC).

Step 5: If you choose Set associative,  you will be asked to input Total Cache Size (S), Cache Line Size (L), Cycles / Cache (CC) and the number of sets.

Step 6: The program will take the user input and give back the output of the updated values of Total Hits, Total Misses, Hit Time, Miss Rate, Miss Penalty, AMAT Value followed by the type of the address processed (data or instruction) and a simulation of a memory caching system.
